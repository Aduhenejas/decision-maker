# decision-maker

A working port to Meteor of a pure Javascript prototype for an app to help people make decisions.

This commit is WIP so not yet functional and a bit messy at this stage.

## TO DO (almost everything, but firstâ€¦)

* limit reasons to around 7 to manage cognitive load/dithering
* add reasons against
* get dynamic (as-changed) slider values and add to template

## DONE

* finish [Meteor tutorial](https://www.meteor.com/tutorials/blaze/creating-an-app) and see what can be used for this project
* make reasons user-CRUD-able (without the 'U') and restrict length of titles
* keep count of reasons
* number slider IDs dynamically from local MongoDB
